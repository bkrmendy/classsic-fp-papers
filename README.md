# Classic FP papers in Scala

In this repo, I'm aiming to implement some FP papers that are either considered classics, or that I'm personally
interested in. So far, the list is the following:

- [ ] Monadic Parser Combinators by Graham Hutton and Erik Meijier
- [ ] The Design of a Pretty-printing Library by John Hughes

This is primarily a learning exercise to pick up some Scala, and also to try out a more rigorous way of ingesting papers
(ie, not just skimming through the first half).
